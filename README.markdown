**My jekyll blog**

This is the code of my jekyll blog at [cantorrodista.com](http://cantorrodista.com). It uses my jekyll forked that you can find [here](http://github.com/cantorrodista/jekyll).

Some of the features added:

- Archives support with pages generated dynamically
- Tagging support with tag pages generated dynamically also
- Post summary generated automatically from post content
